  "text": "Hello, I'm Rajesh Kumar, a 45-year-old man living in a suburban area of Pune. I've been experiencing persistent upper abdominal pain for the past three weeks. The pain started as a mild discomfort but has gradually become more noticeable and bothersome. It's mostly dull and located just under my ribs on the right side. I am concerned because the pain hasn't gone away with over-the-counter antacids that I've tried, which usually help with my occasional acidity. I haven't had any previous surgeries or significant hospitalizations. My medical history includes treatment for H. pylori infection a couple of years ago, but otherwise, I am relatively healthy. I take diet seriously and usually eat home-cooked meals with an emphasis on vegetables and legumes, but I might indulge in spicy street food once a week or so. I work as a software engineer, which means long hours at a desk, though I try to break it up with short walks. I donâ€™t smoke, but I do enjoy a couple of drinks on the weekends. My family doesn't have a significant history of gastrointestinal issues, though both my parents have hypertension. With frequent work deadlines and a couple of sleepless nights recently, I've realized that my stress levels have been a bit high. I do ensure a minimum of six to seven hours of sleep on average, though it can sometimes be interrupted. Our household has clean drinking water, and I live in a rented apartment with my wife, which is clean and well-maintained. Given the persistence of this pain, I am getting quite anxious and unsure if this could be something serious like an ulcer or another issue that might require further investigation.",
