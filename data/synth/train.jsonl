Recently, I have been experiencing sharp chest pains, particularly noticeable when I exert myself physically, like during my routine morning walks or when climbing stairs. This started about two weeks ago and has gradually become more intense, which has been quite concerning. I haven't had any surgeries or hospitalizations recently, but I am on medication for hypertension, which I was diagnosed with about five years ago. My family has a history of heart-related issues, with both my father and grandfather suffering from heart conditions. Although I try to maintain a balanced diet with a mix of south Indian traditional meals and occasional indulgences, my physical activity is limited to the morning walk due to a packed schedule. I get about six hours of sleep on average, which might not be sufficient but is what I can manage. I don't consume alcohol, but I used to be a regular tobacco user until six months ago when I decided to quit. My mental health has generally been stable, notwithstanding the stress from work. I live in a comfortable apartment with access to clean water. I am concerned that these persistent pains might indicate something serious, given my family history and the symptoms occurring with physical exertion.", "extracted": {"age": 52, "sex": "male", "ethnicity": "Indian", "socioeconomic_status": "middle class", "location": "Chennai", "region": "Tamil Nadu", "past_conditions": "hypertension", "surgeries": null, "hospitalisations": null, "chronic_illnesses": "hypertension", "medication_history": "medication for hypertension", "immunisation_status": null, "allergies": null, "family_history": "heart-related issues", "diet": "south Indian traditional meals", "physical_activity": "morning walks", "sleep_pattern": "six hours on average", "alcohol": "none", "tobacco": "used to be a regular user, quit six months ago", "mental_health": "stable", "work_stress": "stress from work", "environmental_exposure": null, "housing": "comfortable apartment", "clean_water": "access to clean water", "occupation": "bank manager", "symptom_duration_map": {"chest pain": "two weeks"}, "symptom_intensity_map": {"chest pain": "gradually more intense"}}, "label_leaf_id": "chest_pain_exertion", "risk": 0.8, "uid": "4fd8037a"}

{"text": "Hi, I'm Ramesh, a 32-year-old male residing in Pune, Maharashtra. Recently, I've been experiencing persistent nausea and an alarming level of dehydration. It all started about a week ago, and I've noticed that it's been getting progressively worse. The thirst constantly bothers me, and no matter how much water I drink, I still feel parched. Along with the nausea, it's becoming difficult for me to keep anything down, be it a simple roti or a full meal. I've not had any serious medical history apart from a few common childhood illnesses like chickenpox. My diet usually includes a balanced mix of vegetables, rice, and occasional chicken, though I've been unable to maintain this due to the discomfort. I work at a call center, which sometimes gets stressful, but I've never had issues with my health linked to my job before. I usually sleep around 6-7 hours daily, though recently, sleep has been disrupted due to frequent trips to the bathroom. My family has no significant medical issues; my parents are generally healthy. We live in a modest apartment complex where water is normally clean, but I've been using filtered options. I don't consume alcohol or tobacco products, and I try to stay active with occasional walks. I'm getting increasingly worried as the symptoms are not subsiding, making it quite uncomfortable to go about daily activities.", "extracted": {"age": 32, "sex": "male", "ethnicity": null, "socioeconomic_status": "middle class", "location": "Pune", "region": "Maharashtra", "past_conditions": ["chickenpox"], "surgeries": null, "hospitalisations": null, "chronic_illnesses": null, "medication_history": null, "immunisation_status": null, "allergies": null, "family_history": null, "diet": "balanced mix of vegetables, rice, and chicken", "physical_activity": "occasional walks", "sleep_pattern": "6-7 hours, disrupted lately", "alcohol": null, "tobacco": null, "mental_health": null, "work_stress": "sometimes stressful", "environmental_exposure": null, "housing": "modest apartment complex", "clean_water": true, "occupation": "call center representative", "symptom_duration_map": {"nausea": "1 week", "dehydration": "1 week"}, "symptom_intensity_map": {"nausea": "increasing", "dehydration": "increasing"}}, "label_leaf_id": "nausea_dehydration", "risk": 0.85, "uid": "f92c42a5"}
{"text": "Hello, my name is Ramesh Kumar, and I'm 34 years old. I live in Pune, Maharashtra, and work as a software engineer for a multinational company. Over the last few days, I've been experiencing constant nausea, which has progressively worsened. Initially, I thought it might have been some bad food, but now I'm feeling extremely dehydrated, despite drinking what I believe to be ample amounts of water. My diet is usually balanced, thanks to our traditional Indian meals, which include chapati, rice, dal, and vegetables. I refrain from consuming alcohol and tobacco products. During this period, I've found it hard to engage in my daily jog around the neighborhood or even focus adequately on my work due to the nausea. It\u2019s been difficult for me to sleep peacefully as well, and I often wake up feeling even more nauseous and parched. Historically, I've been in good health with no major surgeries or hospitalizations, although last year I did have a bout of viral fever. My family has no significant history of diseases apart from some diabetes and hypertension in my parents. I keep myself vaccinated as per the schedule. Living in a fairly clean apartment with access to potable water has always been a priority for me. The recent rise in stress from work deadlines could be playing a part, as well as the occasional dust I encounter during my daily commute. I\u2019m quite concerned that this nausea and feeling of dehydration might be affecting my overall health, and I would appreciate any guidance on managing these symptoms.", "extracted": {"age": 34, "sex": "male", "ethnicity": "Indian", "socioeconomic_status": "middle class", "location": "Pune", "region": "Maharashtra", "past_conditions": ["viral fever"], "surgeries": null, "hospitalisations": null, "chronic_illnesses": null, "medication_history": null, "immunisation_status": "up to date", "allergies": null, "family_history": ["diabetes", "hypertension"], "diet": "balanced traditional Indian meals", "physical_activity": "daily jog", "sleep_pattern": "disturbed", "alcohol": "no", "tobacco": "no", "mental_health": null, "work_stress": "high", "environmental_exposure": "dust", "housing": "clean apartment", "clean_water": "yes", "occupation": "software engineer", "symptom_duration_map": {"nausea": "few days", "dehydration": "few days"}, "symptom_intensity_map": {"nausea": "progressively worsening", "dehydration": "severe"}}, "label_leaf_id": "nausea_dehydration", "risk": 0.75, "uid": "2d89f46f"}
